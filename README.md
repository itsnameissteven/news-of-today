## About the Project

News of Today is a 6 hour take home challenge. Using the New York Times API a user is able to see top stories of the day, travel to a detailed page, sort by category and have the option to redirect to the full article on NYT.com.

#### Landing Page

- When a user visits the site they are able to view the top articles of the day posted by the New York times. Each article is a clickable link. Clicking on a link will redirect the user to a detailed view of the article.

#### Detailed Article View

- After a user clicks on an article they are redirected to the detailed view page. Here a user can view an article abstract and click on a button to be redirected to the full article on an external website.

#### Accessibility

- I made accessiblity a priority when building this app. Users can tab through the entire app to view articles and use 'enter' to control their experience.

#### Error Handling
